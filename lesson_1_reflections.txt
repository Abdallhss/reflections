How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    In case bug exist in only one of them, versions differences can point out to that bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    One can learn about patterns of problems that needed to be revised making him
	a better programmer by avoiding them.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: fewer versions and custom checkpoints
    cons: possibility of missing a crucial commit after some significant modification

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more conected with programming where multiple files in one commit are highly-probable
	to be related.
    On the other hand, Google docs works with files that might not be as related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log would show the changes by viewing generated commits
    git diff is used to show the difference between two commits
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always trace back to where the bug started and fix the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
